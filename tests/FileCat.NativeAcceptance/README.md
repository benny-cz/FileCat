# Native Windows acceptance runner

This runner exercises actual Win32 pointer input against a running FileCat
window. It requires a logged-in Windows desktop, FileCat, and the locally
installed Windows Application Driver listening on `127.0.0.1:4723`. It does
not connect the driver to a network interface.

Run `FileCat.NativeAcceptance.exe find-resize <report.json>` in the Windows
desktop session. The runner opens **Find files** if needed, drags its lower-right
corner outward and back, and writes the measured window dimensions. It fails
unless both dimensions grow substantially and return to their original size.
Use `advanced-resize` with the same report argument to open Advanced criteria,
repeat the drag, and require its eight tested inputs and actions to remain
visible in the native UI Automation tree.

The `snapshot`, `find`, and `advanced` modes are diagnostic: they write the
native UI Automation tree, optionally opening the named FileCat control first.
They are not passing acceptance checks. A screenshot and the JSON result should
be reviewed together when recording native acceptance.
