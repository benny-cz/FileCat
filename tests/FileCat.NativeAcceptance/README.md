# Native Windows acceptance runner

This runner exercises actual Win32 pointer input against a running FileCat
window. It requires a logged-in Windows desktop, FileCat, and the locally
installed Windows Application Driver listening on `127.0.0.1:4723`. It does
not connect the driver to a network interface.

Run `FileCat.NativeAcceptance.exe find-resize <report.json>` in the Windows
desktop session. The runner opens **Find files** if needed, drags its lower-right
corner outward and back, and writes the measured window dimensions. It fails
unless both dimensions grow substantially and return to their original size.
Use `advanced-resize` with the same report argument to open Advanced criteria,
repeat the drag, and require its eight tested inputs and actions to remain
visible in the native UI Automation tree.

Run `editor-picker-cancel <report.json>` to check that the Windows editor
program picker opens and Cancel returns to the unchanged Settings draft. Run
`editor-program-preview <report.json>` to select the existing
`C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe` sample, inspect the nonexecuting preview
with a spaced filename, cancel Settings, and confirm the original editor value
is restored when Settings reopens. The sample program must already be installed
in that location. Both checks leave saved Settings unchanged.

The `snapshot`, `find`, `advanced`, `tools-menu`, `settings`, `settings-tools`,
`editor-browse`, `editor-value`, and `editor-draft-cancel` modes are diagnostic
or setup actions. They do not count as passing acceptance checks. Review the
VM screenshot and JSON result together when recording native acceptance.
